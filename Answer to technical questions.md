# Question 1: How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

I spent around 3 hours in building the application, implementing the functionality, making the application responsive and writing test cases. 

I successfully implemented all required functionalities, including responsiveness, accessibility, sorting based on title and published year. Infact, I wanted to give a better experience for users using this app and hence , I added an additional feature of pagination structuring them semantically based on accessibility making it effective for users to traverse through multiple dataset pages. 

# a. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
# b. If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

If given more time I would have additionally incorporated filter search functionality within the table which would have further enhanced the user experience by allowing users to quickly locate specific items within the dataset. This extra feature would have provided a more efficient and tailored browsing experience.

# Question 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I have added pagination feature to this application because given the huge dataset , to make the user experience better I have added the pagination feature.

#  How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

To track down and resolve a performance issue in a React application in production, I took the following steps:

1. I found that some components were re-rendering unnecessarily. By wrapping these components with React.memo, I ensured they only re-rendered when their props changed.
2. Another issue was - To improve load times, I implemented code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense. This allowed the application to load components only when they were needed, reducing the initial bundle size.

# How would you improve the API that you just used?

Pagination Controls: the API could have been more robust with pagination controls to handle large sets of search results. If the API had such features I could have integrated with the additional feature pagination that I added for the user experience to get effective user experience for searching through data sets. This could include options to specify the number of results per page and the ability to navigate between pages more easily. Based on the number of results loaded say there are more than 300, then get first 100 at one API call, make the next API call to get next 100, that way the component and data load times arenâ€™t affected , they will look smoother.
